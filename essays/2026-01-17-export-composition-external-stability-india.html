<h1>Export Composition and External Stability: Evidence from India’s Balance of Payments</h1>
<p><em>Published: January 17, 2026</em></p>
<p><em>
This article is part of an ongoing research series examining the structural nature of India’s external sector and recurring pressures on the rupee.
</em></p>

<p>
The previous article in this series examined why recurring rupee pressure is better understood as a structural rather than cyclical phenomenon. (<a href="/essays/2026-01-12-rupee-pressure-structural.html">link →</a>).

<h2>Introduction: The External Sector Puzzle</h2> <hr>
<p>Over the past two decades, India’s external sector narrative has increasingly been framed around the rise of services exports. Strong growth in information technology and business services, a sustained services trade surplus, and deeper global integration are often cited as evidence of India’s growing export strength and improving external position.</p>
<p>At the same time, India has continued to experience recurring external pressures, reflected in persistent merchandise trade deficits, episodic current account imbalances, and periodic stress on the exchange rate. This coexistence of visible export success and ongoing external vulnerability raises a basic question about how export performance translates into external stability.</p>
<p>Understanding this gap matters because external stability is not merely an accounting outcome but a structural condition that shapes macroeconomic resilience. If export growth does not reliably anchor the external balance, prevailing narratives may overlook deeper features of the export base that influence long-term currency behaviour and balance-of-payments dynamics.</p>

<h2>Stylised Facts on Export Composition and External Balance</h2> <hr>
<p>India’s external sector data reveal a persistent divergence between merchandise trade outcomes and services trade performance. Over recent years, merchandise (goods) trade has consistently recorded net deficits, while services trade has generated a sustained surplus. These two patterns have coexisted over the same period, forming a defining feature of India’s balance of payments structure.</p>
<p>When viewed at the level of the current account, the services surplus has not been sufficient to fully offset the merchandise trade deficit. As a result, the overall current account has continued to register deficits in most years, despite the strength of services exports. This accounting outcome reflects the simultaneous presence of export earnings growth and recurring external imbalances within the same period.</p>
<p>In terms of scale, services exports constitute a large and relatively stable share of India’s gross domestic product, as reflected in international comparative data. However, current account outcomes display temporal unevenness, with periods of improvement or short-lived surplus occurring alongside more frequent deficit positions over the annual cycle. These patterns indicate that fluctuations in the current account have not translated into a sustained shift in India’s external balance.</p>
  
<h2>Why Export Composition Matters</h2> <hr>
<p>Export performance is often discussed in terms of aggregate growth, yet different types of exports interact with the external balance in distinct ways. Export composition matters because goods and services differ in their import intensity, foreign exchange requirements, and linkages to domestic production. As a result, similar levels of export earnings can have unequal implications for the balance of payments depending on their underlying structure.</p>
<p>In the context of the external account, merchandise exports are closely associated with import demand for intermediate inputs, capital goods, and energy, while services exports typically rely more heavily on domestic labour and skill-intensive inputs. These structural differences shape how export earnings translate into net foreign exchange availability. Treating exports as a homogeneous category can therefore obscure the mechanisms through which export growth affects external stability.</p>
<p>While existing analyses recognise the importance of export performance for external balance, they often emphasise aggregate outcomes rather than export composition. By centring export structure rather than export volume alone, this article reframes the relationship between export growth and external stability as a structural question. The distinction between goods and services exports provides a lens through which persistent external imbalances can be examined without relying on short-term fluctuations or cyclical explanations.</p>
  
<h2>Services Surplus Boundary</h2> <hr>
<p>The presence of a sustained services trade surplus alongside recurring external imbalances indicates that services earnings alone have not translated into full current account stabilisation. While services exports contribute significantly to foreign exchange inflows, their aggregate surplus has coexisted with persistent merchandise trade deficits, resulting in continued pressure at the level of the overall external account.</p>
<p>This coexistence does not imply a weakness of services exports themselves, nor does it diminish their importance to India’s external sector. Rather, it highlights a boundary condition: an aggregate services surplus does not automatically offset the scale and structure of merchandise trade imbalances. The relationship between services earnings and external stability is therefore not one of direct equivalence.</p>
<p>The underlying reasons for this pattern — including differences in scale, composition, and external linkages — are not examined in detail here. Instead, this section establishes the empirical coexistence of services strength and external pressure as a structural feature, setting the stage for a more focused examination of services-led export growth and its limits in a subsequent article.</p>
  
<h2>Implications for External Stability</h2><hr>
<p>Taken together, the preceding sections indicate that external stability cannot be understood solely through aggregate export performance. The coexistence of persistent external pressure with visible export success points to the importance of export structure in shaping balance-of-payments outcomes. This reframing shifts attention away from short-term movements and toward the composition of the export base as a determinant of durability in the external account.</p>
<p>Viewing external stability through a structural lens also alters how recurring currency pressure is interpreted. Rather than reflecting episodic shocks or temporary imbalances, such pressure may be consistent with an export structure in which surplus-generating sectors coexist with large, structurally embedded deficits elsewhere in the trade account. In this sense, external vulnerability emerges not from the absence of export growth, but from the way different export categories interact with import demand and foreign exchange requirements over time.</p>
<p>These implications do not lead directly to policy prescriptions. Instead, they clarify the analytical frame within which questions of external resilience should be examined. By foregrounding export composition, the discussion opens space for a more nuanced understanding of how different growth strategies translate into long-run balance-of-payments stability.</p>
  
<h2>Conclusion and Forward Link</h2><hr>
<p>This article has examined the coexistence of strong export performance and persistent external pressure through the lens of export composition. By documenting stylised facts on trade balances and situating them within a structural framework, it has shown that export growth alone does not necessarily translate into durable external stability. The composition of exports, rather than their aggregate expansion, plays a central role in shaping balance-of-payments outcomes.</p>
<p>By reframing external vulnerability as a structural issue, the discussion moves beyond episodic explanations and short-term adjustments. The persistence of external pressure alongside services-led export strength highlights the importance of examining how different export categories interact with import demand and foreign exchange requirements over time.</p>
<p>The analysis here establishes the conceptual foundation for a more focused inquiry into services-led export growth and its limits. A subsequent article will examine this question in greater depth, exploring the channels through which services exports contribute to — and fall short of — anchoring long-run external balance.</p>
