# Analytical Articles

This section contains analytical articles that form a connected research arc examining India’s external-sector structure and long-term currency stability.

The articles focus on how foreign exchange is earned and financed over time, with particular emphasis on export composition, capital inflows, manufacturing capability, and structural constraints on external stability. Together, they feed into a larger flagship working paper on India’s persistent rupee depreciation.
